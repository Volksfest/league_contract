//! This module contains the main internal logic.
//!
//! Disclaimer: Match would be a wonderful word for a bundle of games between two contestants.
//! Unfortunately, `match` is a bad name in rust due to obvious reasons...
//! I decided for `GameMatch`
//!
//! The player vector `players` shall be immutable.
//! Indexes to that vector are used Instead of references to the player.
//! Mostly easier to handle and actually `PlayerPair` can be made unambiguously by rules.
